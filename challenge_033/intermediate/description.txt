input

The first line of input contains the number of test cases (no more than 20). Each test case consists of one line - five space separated cards. Each card is represented by a two-letter (or digit) word. The first character is the rank (A,K,Q,J,T,9,8,7,6,5,4,3 or 2), the second character is the suit (S,H,D,C standing for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs). The cards can be in any order (but they will not repeat).

Output

For each test case output one line describing the type of a hand, exactly like in the list above.
