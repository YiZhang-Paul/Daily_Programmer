If a right angled triangle has three sides A, B and C (where C is the hypothenuse), the pythagorean theorem tells us that A2 + B2 = C2

When A, B and C are all integers, we say that they are a pythagorean triple. For instance, (3, 4, 5) is a pythagorean triple because 32 + 42 = 52 .

When A + B + C is equal to 240, there are four possible pythagorean triples: (15, 112, 113), (40, 96, 104), (48, 90, 102) and (60, 80, 100).

Write a program that finds all pythagorean triples where A + B + C = 504.
