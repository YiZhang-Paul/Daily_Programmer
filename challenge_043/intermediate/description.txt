Inspired by this Wikipedia article, which was found in the comments in this video, I thought it would be cool to come up with a programme which uses the Doomsday algorithm to determine which day of the week a certain date falls on.

Bonus: Now, learn to perform the algorithm mentally, and create a tester programme! Write another programme which takes parameters (e.g. the desired range of years), give a random date (e.g. if I input that I want a date this year it may output (5/6/2012); if I say I want a date between 1900 and 2100 it may output (17/3/2046)) and then ask for you to enter the day of the week and have the programme tell you if you are correct.
