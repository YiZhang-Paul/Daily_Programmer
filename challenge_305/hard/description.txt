KimCo Global, the global corporation from DPRK, is secretly developing an awesome new product for its loyal costumers called Number. It is what is says - Number, but not just any Number, each Number is a unique positive integer. Each number costs its value - so 1 costs $1, 5 costs $5, etc. KimCo Global puts each number from 1 to 1015 on sale.

Your friend, a salesman for KimCo Global, needs your help to optimize their profits. He received all available Numbers whose sum of digits equals 69 and seeks to sell them for the highest value he can. His regular accountant is of no help, can you assist?

What is the total of positive integers less than 1015 whose sum of digits equal 69?
